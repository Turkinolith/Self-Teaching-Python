**** Function Construction - Default Arguments ****
***************************************************

Consider the following function:
	def print_something(name, age):
	    print("My name is", name, "and my age is", age)

This will work if you pass it the following:
	print_something("Larry", 39)

Why? Because it is not concatonating the values, it simply is printing out the values and to the human eye there is no difference between an int 39 and str "39"

But, lets say I only want to pass just the name value, I can do this with a default argument for age.
To do this, inside the argument list of the function just assign a value to the variable.

	def print_something(name = "Larry", age = "Unknown")
	    print("My name is", name, "and my age is", age)
	
	print_something("Lisa")
	
	//returns: "My name is Lisa and my age is Unknown"
	
	print_something()
	
	//returns:"My name is Larry and my age is Unknown"
