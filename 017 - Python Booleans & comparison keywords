As in other languages, bools are created by comparisons between two things.
5 == 5, 5 > 5, 10 != 10, etc.

Some comparisons dont work on some data types or behave differently based on the type.

  *** PYTHON COMPARISON KEYWORDS ***
As well as comparisons there are Python keywords to also do comparsions.

************
**** is ****
************
Is checks if two arguments are exactly the same thing.

Take these two lists:
friends = ["Larry", "Lisa"]
abroad = ["Larry", "Lisa"]

print(friends == abroad)
// True
The double equals compares the values inside of the two lists and returns true as the values are the same.

print(friends is abroad)
// False 
This checks the memory values, the list "friends" is not the same as the list "abroad", even though the data contained in them is the same.
So, the "is" comparison returns false.

if I did:
print(friends is friends)
// True

Also if I did:
friends = ["Larry", "Lisa"]
abroad = friends
print(friends is abroad)
// True
Because abroad is now just pointer to "friends"
