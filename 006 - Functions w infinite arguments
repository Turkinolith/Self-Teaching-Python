****************************************************
**** Function Construction - Infinite Arguments ****
****************************************************

Lets make a function called print_people
	def print_people()

Now, here is where I pass in arguments for the function, but I don't know how many I'll get.
So I'll start with passing one argument, but it'll be prefixed with an asterisk

	def print_people(*people):

The asterisk tells it that the argument will be an array of all of the arguments passed into the function.
continuing on, I write a for in loop.

	def print_people(*people):
	    for person in people:
		    print("This person is", person)
			
	print_people("Larry", "Lisa", "Monkey", "Pinky", "Squeeks", "Brownie", "Cinnamon")
	
	//returns:
	This person is Larry
	This person is Lisa
	This person is Monkey
	This person is Pinky
	This person is Squeeks
	This person is Brownie
	This person is Cinnamon
