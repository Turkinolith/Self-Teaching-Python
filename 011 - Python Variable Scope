**** Python Variable Scope ****
*******************************

Consider this program:

	print("Simple Calculator")
	print("Type 'quit' to exit\n")

	# Holds result of previously calculated equation. Default 0
	previous = 0
	run = True

	def performMath():
		equation = input("Enter Equation:")
		if equation == 'quit':
			run = False
		else:
			print("You typed", equation)

	while run:
		performMath()

While it is running, if you type 'quit' nothing happens.
Why is this? 
Because the variable "run" is set outside of any function in the program. It's scope is global.
The function "performMath", inside of an if statement within it, is trying to set "run" but it does not have access to that variable scope.
To get access to it I need to bring the run variable inside of the function.

*NOTE: in Pycharm it even has 'run' shaded grey and the tooltip "Shadows name 'run' from outer scope. Local variable 'run' value is not used"

To fix this, use the global keyword on the variable inside of the function.

	def performMath():
		global run
		equation = input("Enter Equation:")
		if equation == 'quit':
			run = False
		else:
			print("You typed", equation)

Now when I type "quit" it will exit.
